Resources are variables that are programmed by the programer that defines menus, dialogs, bitmaps, icons, 
cursors, and program strings.  These are compiled within the Windows Executable near the bottom half of the 
executable below the actual execution code.  Windows executables may be DLL files, EXE files (most common), 
CPL files, and OCX files.  Remember resources are not used in DOS executables.

When a Windows32 API program executes it runs a loop.  This loop is used to take care of all the messages in 
the message gue.  The message gue is where all the events are buffered and they stay there until it is taken 
care of.  At times if the event is not needed it is discarded and not read (This is programmed in the script 
to do this).  A event may be a closing of the window, minimizing, selecting a option in a menu, clicking on a 
button window, typing text, creating a child window, ect...  Within the resource modules there are numbers 
these numbers are the tags used to identify the event that will be stored in the message que (Some of these 
message gue identifiers are predefined in a .h file Ex: WM_DESTROY destroying a window via [x]).   

Example here is the dummy menu in the WebTV Executable:

128 MENU
LANGUAGE LANG_ENGLISH, SUBLANG_ENGLISH_US
{
POPUP "&File"
{
	MENUITEM "&Open File...\tCtrl+O",  57601
	MENUITEM "Open &URL...\tCtrl-U",  32771
	MENUITEM "&Close",  57602
	MENUITEM "Save &As...",  57604
	MENUITEM SEPARATOR
	MENUITEM "&Print...\tCtrl+P",  57607
	MENUITEM "Print Pre&view",  57609
	MENUITEM "P&rint Setup...",  57606
	MENUITEM SEPARATOR
	MENUITEM "E&xit",  57665
}
POPUP "&Edit"
{
	MENUITEM "&Undo\tCtrl+Z",  57643
	MENUITEM SEPARATOR
	MENUITEM "Cu&t\tCtrl+X",  57635
	MENUITEM "&Copy\tCtrl+C",  57634
	MENUITEM "&Paste\tCtrl+V",  57637
	MENUITEM SEPARATOR
	MENUITEM "Pre&ferences",  32772
	MENUITEM "smurf",  32792
}
POPUP "&Help"
{
	MENUITEM "&About WebTV Simulator...",  57664
}
MENUITEM "DUMMY MENU - Don't worry about editing me",  65535
}

"128" Defines the actual resource.  When the window is registered this is used to specify that this menu is 
going to be used for this window.  Im not going to get into the programing its just going to confuse you.  
'POPUP "&File"' is defineing the main window item.  & is used for the underline specifying the alt menu 
shortcut in this case alt+f will open this menu. 'MENUITEM "&Open File...\tCtrl+O",  57601' is defining the 
submenu \t is tab.  57601 is the message que event identifier. 


The reason why I brought this up is Windows has distributed the format of its executable files (needed for 
compilers and software engineers ect...).  The significance of this is that we can edit the resources without 
a source file.  This means if the WebTV Viewer was made to be for WNI employees and then modified to a lower 
scale for consumers and they just left the resources to the employee parts of the code still within the 
script it will still be compiled together and we can later get the employee code and bring it to the top.

WebTV Viewer 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 all have 3 menus.  A debug, employee resource menu; dummy menu and the consumer 
menu.  The hidden menu resource is the most significant resource but there are other unused resources within 
the WebTV Viewer.

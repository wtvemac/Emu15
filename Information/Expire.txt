YOU MAY NOT CLAIM ANY OF THIS AS YOURS.  I HAVE WORKED TO HARD TO DESERVE ANY PIRATING OF MY THEORIES.  I 
MUST STRESS THAT ANY USAGE OF THIS THEORY(S) WITHOUT MY PERMISSION I WILL NOT PERMIT.  <h555>THANK YOU</h555>

Theory(WBIP24)-WebTVs caching comes in two worlds the long-term external caching system and the short-term 
internal caching system each system is inportant to WebTV for retrieving sources to binary and ASCII pages 
faster than to reconnect to the server.

Theory(WBIP24)-Expirering cache is the action taked to clear cache without the sence of a reload.  The 
connection stays constant without a break during this action.

Theory(WBIP24)-Reloading cache is the action taken when the connecion made with a specific server is broke 
and not reconnected.  The cache is not cleared during this action.  It basicly waits for a manual reload or 
for the box to notice there is no connection and reload the page.

The box stores information received over the Internet in internal cache.  This cache may contain setting 
information given by the server i.e. cookie data, or box preferences (default text color ect...)  the cache 
may also contain data that is used for faster access instead of resorting to the server when the source to 
the page has already been given.  However there is a problem with doing this and not updating the cache when 
needed.  WNI as set up a header which expires cache data or reloads it.  If this technique wasn't possible 
then your mailbox will need to be reloaded every new mail or your favorites needs to be reloaded whenever a 
new folder has been added or a new favorite.  The following allows you to manually do this.  Remember WebTVs 
internal cache is cleared after the ROM image has been reloaded into RAM after shut off.  This is not to be 
confused with WebTVs.


Theory(WBIP24)-When the WebTV receiver receives this header then it does a search within its <u>Cache 
List</u> not back list.  The back list contains URLs and is linked to the titles, thumbnails and recent data, 
no contents of the source are contained in the back list.  This search term does not have to be the full URL. 
 WebTV has set up its expire search so that any given part of a URL that matches to the search key term it 
will return true i.e. the search term wtv-home:/biggy both will return true for the following URLs: 
wtv-home:/biggy-strong and wtv-home:/biggy-stiff.  If a match is made then the process to expire the 
corresponding cache data is executed.

Theory(WBIP24)-The box is programmed to execute a constant invisible loop which checks for missing cache 
pages and checks to see if it is possible to retrieve it.  If it is possible to retrieve them then the box 
will do what it has to do to cache this missing needed data.  Cache pages that are needed for the box to run 
properly would be user settings, cookie domain list, favorite list, and the background music list.  One way 
that the box required cache gets interupted is when the page is expired.  Since this loop is constant than 
the page will be requested again if it is possible to do so.

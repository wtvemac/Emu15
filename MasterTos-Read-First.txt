These are the rules you must abide by.  I have set up hidden functions in this server that will detect 
some of these actions that are against the TOS.  If the functions are triggered your program will be 
deleted and useless if reinstalled.  I also have the right if I find the address of the server to manually 
trigger these functions if I find you are disobeying the following TOS agreement.  I have spent some time 
on these functions making it almost impossible to figure out. Please DO NOT open 
this server without reading and agreeing to this document.

What this tool could do for us:

Run executables on the box, make the box download our own made builds, connect to servers that have the 
ticket block and at times register a account there, completely figure out how the box transacts with the 
server.

I have told people in the past that didn't seam to understand the value of this tool what it can do.  
Please don't show off with your "cool" stuff and not give a reason of where this information came from (in 
this case LIE!).  WNI knows how there servers work if they find something suspicious that leans to the 
side of people accessing there servers indirectly then they will try to block these users.  This tool 
isn't a URL accessor and is not to be passed around like one.

I INTRODUCTION


This tool was created to figure out how WNI Servers fully transacts with the box.  If this is found then 
there could be many outcomes that are far beyond the value of a normal URL accessor.  I did not create this 
tool for hacking accounts or any other actions that server no principle.  However hacking accounts to 
figure out the login process or to access a account which has value towards figuring out information (Ex: 
previews/corp account, To figure out user session headers) I will accept.  Hacking a WebTV user account 
to access NGs to look at them for fun I will not accept as a good reason for having this tool.  With the 
purpose of this tool now known I will go on to the details.



II MISSUSES


This tool must be used to figure out things about WebTV there is no other reason that is going to be 
wavered.  When I say figure out things about WebTV I mean things that are needed by the tool and is 
useful towards WebTV tricks.  I will not accept "Find out WebTVs new upgrade version", "Find out if 
there is a new post in webtv.users", "Find out if I can get to http://webtv.com from the proxy", ect.  
You must also know what you are going to do with this data found if it is valid if you are going to 
figure out the login process I want to know the reason why you want to know the login process.  If the 
reason is clear and I know what you are going to do with this tool then I will not ask.



III UNSCRUBIABLE BEHAVIOR


I will not allow any actions that serve no purpose or reason. Any actions that will put this tool in 
jeopardy  for this reason only will not be supported or accepted.  If there is a clear and excellent excuse 
for this I will accept the behavior and not TOS you.  These are a few examples that will put this tool in 
jepardy:

1. Running it on a known host.
2. Keeping the source open to the public
3. Having the source in a vulnerable area such as a host that is know to be hacked.
4. Telling that you found this trick from Eric's server emulator
5. Using the tool on a heavily logged area of WNI.


IV EXCLUSIVITY


I am limiting this tools source to only 5 trusted WebTV hackers who have a valid reason for having it.  I 
am the only one who gives this tool out if you find someone who needs it ask me and I will send it out.  
Once this tool reaches the 5 limit and someone else has a good reason to have must give the data to one of 
the 5 hackers and he will preform the actions needed to satisfy the 6th person.  If this 6th person needs 
to preform these actions himself the Workaround.pl will be given and will not be compiled if he needs the 
WebTV.pl he must write the script himself to preform the actions no help will be given.  This 6th person also 
must have a computer and it must be runned on there it will not be runned on a host and the source will not touch a 
external computers storage.  Overall there is NEVER more than 5 people excluding me that knows the source 
to the WebTV.pl mode 4 script.


VI REGISTRATION KEY

Before you register this program you must enter a correct registration key or you will be TOSd I have the decision to
bring you back.  Before you get the registration key you must ask me YataByte@hotmail.com so I can give you the registration
 information.


VI PRIVACY


Last if you find something on this tool you may do anything will the findings as long as it does not put 
this tool in jeopardy.  You are not required to give it to me or anyone.  You may receive the credit and 
this credit may be received without people knowing its exact origin.

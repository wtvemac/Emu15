As you notice there are some files contained in the /Tools/ directory.  These files are free and can be used as many times as you like.  Im going to explain some of the tools so you can understand how to use them.  What good is it to give you free tools and not explain them!<p>
First point your mouse and click on the /ConnectBenchmark/ directory.  Next click on the ConnectBenchmark.pl icon.  You should get something like the following:

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util1.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
Chose one of the options.  To do this type the number of the option and press enter.<p>

<b>PING</b><p>
This is used to send out packets to the server at a fast rate in order to figure out the speed preformance of the server.  You may specify how large the packet can be and how many pings the benchmarker will send.
<P>
<b>Operational Time</b><p>
This is used to calculate the actual time the server takes to process your simple request.  It will show you the time it takes for the server to actualy see you as well as how long it took to process the command that is sent out.
<P>
<b>Get Info</b><p>
This is used to show the servers information cached in its setting buffer.  It shows the open port, open IP, your IP and port, time, server mode, the client quota, and the client history.
<P>
<b>File server test</b><p>
If the server is on mode 4 it is on the file server mode.  This mode is different than all the others and has different functions.  This benchmark tests these functions and returns the results.

<P>
<b>Latency</b><p>
This basicly finds out how long it takes data to reach the server.  This usualy varies from connection type to connection type and how good the connection is.
<P>
<b>Hault Server</b><p>
This basicly puts the server on hold.  The server will not do anything to any requests untill the command to unhault the server is recieved.
<P>
<b>Close all Clients</b><p>
This closes all clients that are currently connected with the server.  This can be used to flush out all dead connections that are on the server.
<P>

Now point your mouse and click on the /FileClean/ directory. Next click on the FileClean.pl icon. You should get something like the following:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util2.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
Type in the file you wish to matiplate.  If you wish to use the SmartReplace (explained later) this feild can be left black.  Press enter and you should get something like this.
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util3.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
Next type in the number you wish to use that coresponds to a option.
<p>
<b>Binary Chop</b><p>
This option is used to open the chosen file and take out the neadless binary characters.  It outputs the final result in BinaryChop.txt.<p>
<b>Smart Replace</b><p>
This is a great tool created by me that enables you to matiplate a file dynamicly.  It started out as a simple replace tool but it eventualy ended up a verry advanced replace tool.  Since this is advanced there it allot of featurs.  To many to explain here.  Please open the SmartReplaceProc.wtv file for details on how to setup this tool.<p>
<b>Sort</b><p>
This option is used to open the chosen file split it by \n (or line by line) and sort it alpanumericly.  This is a good tool if you need to sort a list of names ect..<p>
<b>Get WebTV FR Part Info</b><p>
Under therory this tool will get the info including the signatur of a flashROM part.  You can either get the part info over the network or from a file.<p>
<b>Clean up packet dump</b><p>
This tool will try its best to orginize all the requests from a packet dumb file rendered from a butSniff utility.<p>
<b>Clean up WebTVIntel.exe</b><p>
This will organize the WebTVIntel.exe file for Viewer 1.0, 2.0 and 2.5 it discludes all of the first half of the file so you can search for the data you need verry eaisily.<p>

<br>
Now point your mouse and click on the /NumberSystemConvert/ directory. Next click on the NumberSystemConverter.html icon. You should get something like the following:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util4.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
This tool is used to convert between number systems.  A algorithm created by me allows you to convert to virtualy any number system from a number.
<p>
<br>
Now point your mouse and click on the /TicketScanPro/ directory. Next click on the TicketScanPro.pl icon. You should get something like the following:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util5.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
This utility is used to get the wtv-ticket to a service which could help us access ticket requiering server such as wtv-home or wtv-tricks.  You can put a range of IPs to get many servers and you can set a ping value so you can get multible ticket certificates to a server.  If you did all this properly it should work ok.

</center>
<p>
<br>
Now point your mouse and click on the /TricksCrackling/ directory. Next read this message:<p>
<i>Under law in most states passwords are considered as property with value and steeling this property is one thing.  Entering the system with the password will be another charge.  I did not test this on WNI networks and it is solely up to you to do it.  Please be aware of this.</i><p>
If you have read this message and still willing to use this tool click on TrksPswdCrack.pl you should get a window like the following:
<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util7.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
This tool will ask you what server you want to crack and how you want to crack it.  The SSID is used to bypass the accountdisabled block (if it does).<p>
<b>Fast Scan</b><p>
This option uses WNIs constant connection.  Instead of disconnecting every password test it will stay connected to the server allowing you to cut the scan time in half eliminating the time it takes to connect to the server.<p>
<b>Password List</b><p>
This option takes the passwords in the PassDict.txt file and tryies them on the server.<p>
<b>Password Matiplation</b><p>
This option takes the passwords from the password file and changes them to what a person would normaly use for a password.  Ex: hack=h4ck..<p>
<b>Brute Force</b><p>
This is a password cracker trick used to test every possible compination.  You are able to select how you want to use brute force and even define the characters, starting char length and to put a check on for checking to see if there are english vowels in the word.
<p>
<br>
Now point your mouse and click on the /ScanHelp/ directory. Next click on the ScanHelp.pl icon. You should get something like the following:

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util8.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>

<p>

This utility scans a range of IPs and ports looking for the help responce from the server.  Withing the help respince is important information about the server including server version and URLs.  You are able to specify the range of the IPs from a IP file (IP.txt) or chose your own range.<p>


<br>
Now point your mouse and click on the /PortPro/ directory. Next click on the PortPro.pl icon. You should get something like the following:

<p>
<center>
<img src="images/Util9.JPG" width=450 height=350>
</center>
<p>
This utility scans a range of IPs and ports looking to see if the server is connectable from your computer.  You may use a IP file (IP.txt) or specify a range of IPs yourself.<p>
<b>Target.txt</b><p>

This is the file that defines how to use the scaned IP:PORT after we had established that it is connectable.  This file is perl so it allows for better usage of the IP and port.  I am using a simple way of writing to a file the IP and ports which is the following script:<p>
<i><font size=2>
<pre>
###############
#Regular print#
###############

open(FILE,">> ScanedPorts.txt");
print FILE "$curIP:$vvv\n";
close(FILE);
</pre>
</font></i>
<p>

You pay uncomment the other scripts to use the other functions I have made.  Remember to comment the one above before doing this or bothe will be entangled with one another in the file.  This one sets the IP and ports up into links.<p>


<i><font size=2>
<pre>

#######
#Links#
#######

print FILE "<a href=$curIP:$vvv>$PortDesc{$vvv}</a><p>";
</pre>
</font></i>
<p>
This one is used to setup a service list!<p>

<i><font size=2>
<pre>
##############
#Service List#
##############

$Yada=$PortDesc{$vvv};
$blue=substr($Yada,index($Yada,"(")+1);
chop($blue) if (index($blue,")") > (-1));
@lala=split(/\,/,$blue);
open(FILE,">> ScanedPorts.txt");

foreach (@lala){
if(substr($_,0,1) eq " "){
$_=substr($_,1);
}

print FILE "wtv-service: name=$_ host=$curIP port=$vvv\n";

}
close(FILE);
</pre>
</font></i>
<p>

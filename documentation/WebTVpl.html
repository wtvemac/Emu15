Ok, this is a fairly simple task to learn.  If your new to this please go to the direcroty that you unziped the program into.  First I will explain how to register.<p>




<p><br>
Now lets get down to the greasework, get into the correct directroy.  It should look like the following but not so squished:

</center>
<p>

Ok, if you would just click on the WebTV.exe icon.  If you did then you should be prompted to enter a regestry key and name.  Please type this in correctly or your fucked!  Example would be like so: "eric,1234" (without the qouts) no spaces beteen the two just a comma.  Remember this if you have the habit to add a space after the comma.  The number you must ask me.  Give me your name you want to use and I will give you the number to use.

If you did this correctly you should get a message like this.  Otherwise you typed something in wrong and the entire directory that contains the WebTV.exe file will be delete.

Ok at this point if you have successfully registered and instaled WebTV.exe you should get a window like the following:

</center>
<p>
As I said LIKE you may have a different window if your settings are different.  I have separated the configuration settings (explained in more detail in the ReadMe.txt file) and the connecttion data by two spaces.  Please disregaurd the error message this is only used to post your IP on a Web page so you wont have to keep on telling a WebTV user what it is.  It is programed to do this to http://cooltude.virtualave.net/Nap.txt you can change this which will be explained in the ReadMe file.  Anyways please open the viewer and go to the "client:gotoconnectionsetup or client:gotoconn" and enter the data the data in the DOS window above so you can connect.  If the IP is too long and you can remember your computer intranet name you can put that in the IP section of connectsetup.  Ex: 209.245.111.111 for "oemcomputer".

Click connect and you should be brought to a connection screen.  Just wait till the viewer contacts the server.  At times you mite need to manualy enter "wtv-1800:/preregister?" if the viewer doesn't contact the server within 10 seconds.  Sorry for the screen.  The PAL setting messed up the Viewer can't get rid of the damn thing.  Don't feel like changing it or editing it out, ohg lazy huh?

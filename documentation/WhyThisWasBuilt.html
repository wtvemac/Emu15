	<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#000199" width=100%><tr><td align=center>Introduction</td></tr></table><p>As you may know this tool is used to emulate a WNI server.  This tool has been futher updated to almost compleatly emulate a WNI server.  I have made it have the ability to expand with the creation of a macro file that combines the well known languages, mIRC Script and perl.  This should make it easier since you don't have to memorize any new statements or functions.  At that it makes it esier for me, I don't have to sit compiling commands for the tool and figuring out how im going to make the progtam parse it.  Provided you can create a script which sences the commands being sent to the server you can finnaly create a WNI server that is easy to update.<p>
	Along with this I have included some other tools that serve help in some situations.  The Ticket Scanner helps to easly get the ticket to a server in a wide IP width which is fast and you don't have to do any work.  The Help Scanner is helpfull if you want to grab some urls or find out the server version to a wide number of IPs this may help if a server was updated and you want to see what has chenged.  The Connect Benchmark tool is good if you want to test how your server is preforming.  The server is set up to work with this tool.  I built this tool for myself but I figured it mite be helpfull for you to test out the preformance of your server at a point in time.<p><br>
	<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#000199" width=100%><tr><td align=center>Why Make a WNI server Emulator</td></tr></table><p>The reson why I made this tool is so I can figure out what WNI goes through.  I know we don't have a large population of users but when making a server for the boxes what they would have to think of when making certen scripts.  The second reson why I made this tool is to figure out how the box transacts with the server.  I have already found out allot from having people and myself connect to this server.  I hope this will help finnaly close the mistery on how the box transacts with the server.<p><br>
	<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 bgcolor="#000199" width=100%><tr><td align=center>Future Updates</td></tr></table><p>The things I have planed in the future is that the server should have a fully working mail SMTP (but no mail domain) server this is provided that I find out how the notification server transacts with the box.  You should also have secondary users.  I also have planed to try my best to transform this script to work on Tk or Win32::GUI this should allow better interactivity and get rid of the ugly DOS console window. There is much more that mite come to you in the future so enjoy!

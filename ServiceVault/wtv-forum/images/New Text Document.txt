a=Vertex angle
b=Equal base angles

a+b2=180 (Isosceles tiangles)
(a(0.5)+b)+90=180 (Right Triangles formed by the median perpindicular to the base of a isocselece triange)


y^2 + x^2 = r^2  (Rotation in a circle which is in a constant location.)
y^(2/3) + x^(2/3) = r^(2/3) (Rotation in a circle which is scattered.)

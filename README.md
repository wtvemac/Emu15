# WebTV Server Emulator 1.5

This is an old server I built in the early 2000s when I was in high school. It's designed to allow a WebTV box (or viewer) to connect and experience what WNI offered but with a local server.

It allows for multiple services and has a custom event language based on the mIRC scripting language. This is very similar to the [2.5 Server Emulator](https://github.com/wtvemac/Emu25 "2.5 Server Emulator") but isn't multithreaded, doesn't support CGI and only listens on one port. Before this server, there was [WorkAround.pl](https://github.com/wtvemac/Emu15/blob/main/WebTVEMu25.pl "WorkAround.pl") which is a basic server you'd connect to that setup a custom service list and forward you to the official WNI servers.

This was only give out to a few people back in the day. The WebTV hacking culture was very close-lipped either for legal reason, to avoid being terminated or maybe even to feel special about being one of the "chosen hackers". I have no desire to control the distribution of my tools anymore... so here it is :)

There's some help files in the **documentation** directory. I've also included my old  WebTV Box Information Pages (WBIP) in the **Information** directory which include some of my old reverse engineering notes.

This is meant for archival purposes. This hasn't been worked on in years. It's here for you to see my excellent programming and spelling skills.

I'd suggest you take a look at https://github.com/zefie/zefie_wtvp_minisrv if you want something more modern.
